# VBAtutoringAntiques

I was lazy (still am a little). In my old tutoring job, I juggled between students preparing for the HSC (the finals in their last year in high school) and juniors in primary school. To create resources to practice, I needed to research for questions and solutions and come up tailored ones on my own. This took a while so when the juniors just needed chunks of simpler or relatively more repetitve questions to practice, I needed an efficient solution.

*Voila* my lazy solution (didn't really have the concept of developing of a UI back then but it is a skeleton :))
